1.) Create Test cases for sending, receiving and deleting multiple messages 
2.) Create Testcases for listing, deleting Queues
3.) Create Tescases for multiple combinations of negative scenarios
4.) TearDown(): Delete Message Queues that were created during each Testcase
5.) Only Validated MessageBody in ReceiveMessage test, should also validate MessageAttributes
6.) Validate other parameters in API calls such as DelaySeconds, VisibilityTimeout, WaitTimeSeconds
7.) Maintain all Err Messages, Err Codes and other Err Attributes in a separate json file rather than
    hardcoding in the testcase. This will help in easy maintainability in future if the ErrMessage changes
8.) Test message Polling
